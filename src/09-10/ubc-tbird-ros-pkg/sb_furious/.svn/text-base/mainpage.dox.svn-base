\b sb_furious contains the driver for the Furious microcontroller 
board, which Snowbots used in the 2009 and 2010 competitions.  It
also provides an emulator for the microcontroller, which can aid
testing and debugging when the board is not physically present.


\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
